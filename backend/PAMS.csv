The Drum’s Dream,"Showcase, Dance",Gamblerz Crew x Goblin Party,"
Gamblerz Crew and Goblin Party are two performance collectives that explore contemporary movement by crossing the boundaries of genre, each rooted in different physical languages: breaking and contemporary dance.
With over twenty years of performing on the global stage, Gamblerz Crew has established itself as a legend of Korean breaking through its energy and technical prowess. Their collaboration with Goblin Party, a contemporary dance company that sensuously expresses everyday humor and social insight, creates a new synergy.
The two teams transcend the boundaries of genre and form, continually seeking new points of connection with audiences through hybrid performances that carry social messages.
Through joint creation and experimentation, they offer flexible and daring possibilities for collaboration in both the domestic and international dance scenes.","Gamblerz Crew x Goblin Party like the saying “Wood soaked in water is tougher than iron,” raise questions about broken communities and the possibility of restoration through the entwined sweat, movement, and breath of community members. In a contemporary society pervaded by emotional undercurrents of psychological anxiety, alienation, hatred, and division, ‘The Drum’s Dream’ artistically explores a journey toward restoring community—longing for the drumbeat to echo once more. In traditional societies, the drum was not only a tool for communication and harmony but also the spiritual and cultural center of the village community. Yet it also came to symbolize something taken lightly—easily struck by many hands. The title The Drum’s Dream draws on this duality, evoking both unity and discord, respect and marginalization within a community. This work combines these symbolic meanings with shamanic beliefs to express the processes of fear, division, and solidarity taking place inside and outside the community, using a fusion of contemporary dance and breaking. The Drum’s Dream portrays a narrative of communal disarray and healing, interpreting the interplay between physical movement and collective psychology through dance.

SHIMMERING,"Showcase, Dance",LEEYANGHEE,"
Lee Yanghee Lee is an artist who engages with the language of performance art, creating temporary theatre environments and presenting her works in exhibition formats. She began her career as a (new) traditional Korean dancer and actively took part in the underground club culture that thrived in Korea during the 1990s. Through her practice, Lee navigates the hybrid and unexplored realms between ‘tradition and contemporary art.’ channeling the history of her own body as a living archive. Her work delves into the essential qualities of Korean dance gestures and her own archetypal movements, addressing everything that constitutes dance itself: the body, pleasure, and form as central themes. Lee critically examines the conventions and hierarchies of """"tradition,"""" that were shaped through the modernization process led by the West and Japan, and envisions a new kind of total art, a gathering through dance.
She was an artist-in-residence at New York Live Arts (2011) and Movement Research (2014–2016), and received a fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council in 2016. Her notable works include Shimmering, Aficionado, Twixt, Twig, Hedonist, Hail, Gesamtkunstwerk, Dusk, and Unlearn: Form and Cliché. Her major solo exhibitions include Axis and Feet (The Page Gallery, 2024), IN (Whistle, 2024), and Hail (d/p, 2020). Selected group exhibitions include Seeing in the Dark (Busan Biennale, 2024), Big Brother Blockchain (Nam June Paik Art Center, 2024), Theater: Post Media and Site (Busan Museum of Art, 2023), Landscape of Life: Hello Again Today (Ulsan Art Museum, 2023), Play, Pause, Repeat (Boan Inn, 2023), Flesh Stone Oil (WESS, 2022), and The Golden Age of the Gold Rush (Ilmin Museum of Art, 2020)","<Shimmering>, by choreographer Lee Yanghee, is the final work in her <Trilogy of the Pleasure of Dance>, following <Gesamtkunstwerk> (2019) and <Hail> (2020). This piece represents the pinnacle of the choreographer’s total art experience, inviting everyone to the “pleasure of dance” by integrating the traditional Korean dance style (shin-muyong), which Lee Yanghee has long mastered, with rave culture, painting, fashion, and club music. Centering on Korean traditional dance and electronic music as its two main pillars, Shimmering unfolds through themes, structures, and variations—following a format reminiscent of a classical symphony. The title Shimmering (meaning flickering and shining) refers both to the defining characteristics and advanced techniques Lee Yanghee discovered within traditional Korean dance movements, as well as to the radiant state of a dancer who, through intense and rigorous training, has fully realized the form and mastery of the dance. Shimmering celebrates the condensed history of time and the body embedded in each dancer’s unique movement, shaped through long and rigorous training. Based on the foundational style of Lee Yanghee—formed through her embodied experience of traditional Korean dance (Shin-muyong) and 1990s club dance culture—the piece requires each dancer to demonstrate advanced technique, personal interpretation, and spontaneous decision-making in real time. Born from a deep respect for all those who have encountered the world through dance, Shimmering invites both dancers and audiences into a radiant state of shared pleasure.",15-Oct,16:20 ~ 17:00,Lee Yanghee,"	Kang Hanna, Kim Seunghyun, Park Sohee, Song Yoonju, Lee Yanghee, Lee Jaea, Jung Hanbyul, Jo Yoenhee, Choi Seung-yoon, Mang Esilo",60min,17,13,4,Lee Yanghee,limbo97@gmail.com,"Haneul Round Theater, National Theater of Korea",#Yangheelee #koreantraditionaldance #clubdance #rave #edm
"Lee Jaram Pansori 'Snow, Snow, Snow'","Showcase, Multidisciplinary/Others",Wansung Playground,"Wansung Playground is a creative performing arts group led by the artist and founder, Lee Jaram. Lee Jaram has established a unique position in the Korean performing arts scene as the creator and sorikkun (traditional pansori singer and storyteller) of pansori works such as <Sacheon-ga>, <Eokcheok-ga>, <Stranger’s Song>, and <The Old Man and the Sea>. These productions have received unprecedented acclaim from both audiences and critics, consistently selling out performances. She has grown into an artist who is highly acclaimed not only in Korea but also internationally. Her pansori works have been consecutively invited to diverse cultural regions such as France, Romania, Poland, the United States, Brazil, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, where they have created a strong resonance with local audiences. Moreover, at the request of performing arts professionals, she has conducted multiple pansori workshops in France for students and professional actors.

<Key Artist Introduction>
* Lee Jaram (Writer/Composer/Singer):
Lee Jaram first encountered pansori at the age of 10 and was soon recognized for her talent by legendary masters—including Eun Hee-jin, Oh Jung-sook (former holders of National Intangible Cultural Heritage), Song Soon-seop (current holder of the Jeokbyeokga pansori), and Seong Woo-hyang (former holder of National Intangible Cultural Heritage)—from whom she studied all five traditional pansori repertoires. While studying at Seoul National University’s Department of Korean Traditional Music, she began to contemplate how to express the stories she wanted to tell through traditional pansori. Finally, in 2007, she presented <Sacheon-ga> to the world, taking on multiple roles as composer, lyricist, and sole performer. Her captivating performance created a significant impact on the performing arts scene.
Following this, her pansori work Ukchuck-ga, which premiered at LG Arts Center, achieved unprecedented success with sold-out performances and standing ovations, solidifying her reputation as a leading young artist in Korean culture. Her innovative pansori adaptations based on Gabriel García Márquez’s short stories and Ernest Hemingway’s novel—Stranger’s Song and The Old Man and the Sea—further showcased her creative and performing talents. Lee Jaram also received critical acclaim for her portrayal of ‘Song-hwa’ in the musical Seopyeonje, earning Best Actress awards at both The Musical Awards and the Korean Musical Awards. Currently, she is actively engaged across a wide range of genres, including changgeuk (Korean traditional opera) and interdisciplinary productions, serving as a music director, composer, lyricist, writer, and performer.

A vast snowfield, where a song of life unfolds overnight
The new work <Lee Jaram Pansori: Snow, Snow, Snow> is a pansori reinterpretation of Tolstoy’s short story <Master and Man>. This is Lee Jaram’s first new piece in five years since <The Old Man and the Sea> (2019), and it premiered in April 2025 as a co-production with LG Arts Center Seoul. Borrowing the traditional pansori style known as batangsori—which was first showcased in <The Old Man and the Sea>—the story unfolds through the drum, witty banter, and vocal narration alone. Describing her work as, “I create new pieces,” she says, “but in the end, I am practicing tradition.” Lee Jaram adds her own unique color while preserving the essence of pansori in this new piece. Through <Snow, Snow, Snow> Lee Jaram seeks not only to popularize pansori by reimagining the universal themes of humanity expressed by a world-renowned literary master, but also to invite audiences to engage deeply with the core values of performing arts: ‘empathy’ and ‘love for humanity.’ While maintaining the traditional characteristic of the “empty stage,” stage designer Yeo Shin-dong participates as the scenographer, enriching the narrative through the use of lighting. The production is directed by Park Ji-hye of Yangson Project, who previously served as dramaturg and director for <Stranger’s Song> and <The Old Man and the Sea>.

in:out,"Showcase, Music",WHATWHY ART,"WhatWhy Art is a Korean contemporary music ensemble that encompasses both tradition and modernity. Based on music and sounds accumulated over a long period, it realizes contemporary art through multiple perspectives. It carries out innovative artistic experiments through collaboration, preserving the unique identity of Korean music while pursuing the expansion of contemporaneity and a forward-looking vision.
WhatWhy Art places existence before questions or generates questions themselves. Their aim is not to provide answers; rather, the question itself often becomes the purpose and goal. With a focus on humanity, life, environment, and society, they create works that deconstruct materiality and its underlying narratives, independence and interconnectedness, and especially the continuity revealed through the genealogy of time.
Supported by the Arts Council Korea, the ensemble has been invited to major festivals including the Seoul Performing Arts Festival(SPAF) and the Korea Improvised Music Festival. Key works include <Music on Life and Death: Saengsaui>(2019), <One Moment>(2020), <Reflection>(2021), <Eternal Moments>(2022), <7 Ways>(2022), <Trembling>(2023–2024), and <in:out>(2024).","
The main theme of the concert installation <in:out> is the concept of “deboundarization” concerning binary divisions. It approaches the relational nature of boundaries in a multi-layered way and expresses, through performance, an acknowledgment of diversity and the concepts of inside and outside themselves. <in:out> questions the boundaries of a divided world by fluidly crossing between traditional and contemporary musical styles, shaking up fixed boundaries and granting freedom to segmented divisions. To achieve this, it reimagines longstanding Korean musical traditions—such as Jongmyo Jeryeak, Munmyo Jeryeak, pansori, and gagok—within a contemporary context. Through a performance that pursues open spatiality, performers and audience members share an irreplaceable embodied time together in the same space and moment, intertwining as equal ritual participants and allowing them to deeply sense one another. <in:out> asks again about many of the distinctions made within the performance. This questioning of boundaries leads to a reconsideration of identity, often narrowly defined, and an exploration of relationships, thereby creating possibilities for new changes. By re-questioning boundaries — the unclear divisions of who or what is inside or outside — <in:out> restores the richness lost to rigid separations, allowing audiences to experience a newly expanded musical space-time.",15-Oct,19:00 ~ 19:40 ,Kang Ji-eun,"Kang Ji-eun, Kim Woong-sik, Yoo Hong, Lee Na-rae, Lee Hwa-young",60min,7,5,2,Kim Se-hee,whatwhy_doc@naver.com / whatwhyart@gmail.com,Seoul Namsan Gugakdang,"""There exist things beside us that unfold like an endless spectrum between light and darkness—things that cannot be conceptualized, things deemed unnecessary even to conceptualize, and things that have never had the chance to be conceptualized.

Major works include <Flight>(2016), <0g>(2018), <Übermensch>(2019), <Your Symptoms>(2020), and <Mobility> (2021). The company has received numerous honors, including commendation from the minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2021; the Jury President’s Award at the 5th Seoul Dance Film Festival for the dance film Übermensch; the Best Performance Award at the 26th Dance Arts Awards hosted by Changmu Arts Center in 2020; and the Best Work Award from the Korean Dance Critics Association in 2019. In 2023, Melancholy Dance Company began expanding beyond the field of dance, starting with a performance featured in the MMCA Hyundai Motor Series: Little Ark, an exhibition by Choe U-Ram at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) in Seoul. Since then, the company has been seeking to expand its presence not only in Korea but also on international stages.

Jeong Cheol-in, founder and artistic director of Melancholy Dance Company, began his creative journey with the work Free Fall in 2014. Since then, he has actively created and presented works such as <Flight>(2016), <0g>(2018), <Übermensch>(2019), <Your Symptoms>(2020), <Mobility>(2021), and <Unprotected>(2022), earning recognition from the dance community for his choreographic expertise and promising potential. With a focus on physicality, Jeong explores diverse movement styles and modes of expression to craft performances that deeply connect with audiences. Through consistent dedication and sincerity, he continues to develop his artistic vision as both a dancer and choreographer.","<Your Symptoms> directly addresses the identity crisis and social issues faced by modern individuals, expanding the boundaries of perception and sensation. Today, people live with unnamed emotions—loneliness, sorrow, anxiety, psychological wounds, and a lack of love. Yet they conceal their inner pain behind expressionless faces, rarely revealing their emotional scars to the outside world. This work intricately expresses the loneliness and emotional unease of modern individuals and, through a deep exploration of universal human sentiments, proposes a fresh mode of contemporary stage expression that encourages expanded reflection and thought. Audiences expand personal experiences into universal emotions, sharing a complex experience through physical movement and the structural experimentation of dance. Through <Your Symptoms>, audience members are invited to observe their unresolved emotions, break free from a social structure that inhibits emotional expression, and enter their own symptoms with both sincerity and playfulness.

Youngho Lee is the founder and lead creator of FORCE, a performance arts company that uses the body as its primary language under the belief that ""the body is humanity’s first and most honest universal language."" A graduate of the Department of Acting at Seoul Institute of the Arts, he began his career on large-scale musical and performance stages before establishing FORCE to pursue original creative work. Thereafter, he has participated in training programs at various institutions both in Korea and abroad, consistently exploring ways to integrate physical performance with contemporary technology. Lee believes that art should go beyond expression to reflect the spirit of the times and respond to the emotions of people. His works combine technology and narrative in creative circus performances, capturing contemporary sentiments and social awareness while aiming for a deep emotional resonance with the audience.","Fusion of Art and Technology: Crafting a New Future Together with Robots
Amid the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI and robotic technologies have advanced to a stage where they can learn from and respond to human life, labor, and even emotions. <Gyogam (Access)>, which presents robots not merely as machines but as active performers who emotionally respond and collaboratively create narratives, was conceived to explore the possibilities of emotional interaction between humans and robots at this pivotal moment in history. <Gyogam (Access)> is Korea’s only robotic art circus performance that combines an industrial robot arm (KR300 R2700-2) with circus performance, where human vitality and mechanical precision meet on stage to create a new sensory experience. The robot transcends its mechanical nature to breathe alongside actors as a character, and the audience experiences unfamiliarity and intimacy, boundaries and connection, simultaneously in the scenes where they intersect. <Gyogam (Access)> experiments with the artistic potential of robotic technology, aiming to reduce the sense of alienation toward new technologies and expand the boundaries of art. This performance, where humans and robots respond to each other’s movements in harmony, envisions a future where technology and art coexist. The coexistence of humans and machines is no longer a choice but an essential contemporary issue we must confront to thrive in today’s world.

","The universe is often described as a vast macrocosm, while humans are likened to corresponding microcosms. Within each person lie all the elements and forces of the cosmos, and we each carry our own unique world within us. <Elephants Laugh> has, through various performances, confronted the invisible boundaries and barriers that exist between strangers, creating moments of connection across those divides. <Between Glances: A Symphony of the Unsaid> brings together the community and performers from previous productions to collaboratively create a new work. It invites both audience members and performers, as representatives of various social issues, to share a moment of authentic encounter and mutual engagement. At the instant when people truly face one another, we discover each other’s “doors.” In that brief eye contact, a connection to another indescribable world begins, awakening senses that have long grown dull. Through themes of gaze, attention, relationship, and connection, <Between Glances: A Symphony of the Unsaid> allows participants to experience these ideas through bodily and visual language. By experimenting together with the possibilities of human connection on stage, both audience and creators artistically propose a way to bridge the growing distance between people in modern society, offering a sensory and thoughtful experience. “To face someone” can sometimes offer simple, warm comfort, while at other times it may bring discomfort and unfamiliarity. Yet in these encounters, we seek to witness moments when different worlds—too complex to be fully expressed in words—gradually come together as one harmonious chorus.

Above all, UHEE Company pursues a contemporary form of Yeonhee that breathes with the public, aiming to highlight the hipness and charm of Yeonhee in a way that appeals to younger generations. The company has gained recognition through performances such as Uheenori, which expresses traditional rhythms and Samulnori (traditional Korean percussion) with a youthful sensibility and interactive participation, and UHEESKA Ninano Pancert, which fuses traditional Korean rhythms with Jamaican ska music to reinterpret it as a unique form of world music.

The resonance of unfinished instruments awakens, and the world of Yeonhee (Korean traditional performance) unfolds through the rhythms of Jwajilgut and Ujilgut, traditional Korean percussion patterns representing the left and right sides in ritual performances.
The sangsoe maintains balance on the tightrope, guiding the flow of energy. Through the principles of symmetry and connection, they come to feel the oneness of nature and the universe. As they overcome inner tension and conflict, the performance builds toward the ecstatic climax of shinmyeong—a euphoric explosion of spirit and energy. Ogum is more than just a movement—it is the core rhythm of the universe that flows through and connects every moment of the performance. This never-ending rhythm drives the heartbeat of Yeonhee (Korean ritual performance), marking each moment as a new beginning.
<Yeonhee Physics: The Quantum Ritual> is a stage performance that sheds new light on the movement and aesthetics of traditional Korean Yeonhee (traditional Korean ritual performance). It blends the imagination of Yeonhee with fundamental questions posed by modern physics—about reality, space-time, and the principles of the universe.

OffOn Yeonhee project II,"Showcase, Multidisciplinary/Others",LIQUID SOUND,"Liquid Sound, founded in 2015, is a collective that fosters interdisciplinary exchange rooted in Korean traditional arts. Rather than simply preserving or transforming traditional arts, they seek to discover the potential for tradition to grow and thrive as an expanded artistic field.
The collective collaborates with artists from various fields—including contemporary dancers, traditional performers, computer musicians, directors, and stage designers—who interpret shared themes through diverse perspectives. By exploring uncommon subjects such as human relationships and tactile imagery, Liquid Sound stimulates artistic imagination and engages in collaborative creation aimed at discovering intersections across artistic disciplines.
They have been active both in Korea and Europe through close collaborations with the French ensemble Ensemble Passage and the German theater company Baal NOVO. Their activities include an official invited performance commemorating the 130th anniversary of Korea-France diplomatic relations, participation in a residency at the Baal NOVO Theater in Germany, the JOURNEY TO KOREAN MUSIC project hosted by the Korea Arts Management Service, and the “Korean Traditional Music Meets Baroque: Cathedral Tour in France” performance.","Modern Experimentation with Yeonhee, a form of traditional Korean performing arts, through Deconstruction and Reconstruction
As an extension of Liquid Sound’s first Yeonhee deconstruction project, <KIN :>, this performance focuses on the deconstruction and reconstruction of traditional Yeonhee. It breaks down the distinctive movements and lively spirit of traditional Yeonhee, applying variations to movements and moods centered on playful elements from Nongak, such as Dangsan Beollim and Seoljanggu. The title combines the words “Off” (to detach) and “On” (to attach), encapsulating the concept of breaking away from old customs and attaching to new artistic expressions. It also implies the separation and reattachment of various materials. Based on the deconstruction of the body and performance props, various elements of traditional Yeonhee—such as timing, rhythm, body movements, tools, and instruments—are broken down and reassembled in diverse ways to create dynamic, transformative energy. Thus, <OffOn Yeonhee Project II> uncovers the fundamental nature and interrelations of the elements comprising Yeonhee, seeking to reflect on the very essence of Yeonhee that remains after all deconstructible elements have been dismantled.

His writing captures moments of life and work with a poetic sensibility uniquely his own. Poet Yongjoo Lee said, “This place embodies a world where life and poetry coexist as one.” Literary critic Sooyi Kim praised Yonghoon Lee’s writing style as “a cycle where prose overwhelms poetry, and poetry in turn embraces prose.” Lee Yong-hoon’s style is simple and calm, carrying the scent of labor like that of ginkgo nuts. He still works as a demolition laborer while continuing to write.

The narrative expands through light, shadow, and objects, unfolding with literary language, while its calm storytelling reaches the audience through the power of the space. Through the movement of light and shadow, it evokes memory and traces, questioning what it means to live. Where old buildings have been demolished, new ones rise; and even those who have said their last goodbyes to life, tomorrow comes. Just as only a leveled foundation remains after demolition, the stage once filled with objects, light, and shadows, returns to its beginning after bidding farewell to death. <Mr. Nobody: The wanpan Edition of Sledgehammer Mr. Baek's Journal> questions passing existences and memories, embodying the ‘meaning of living every day.

Known for a practice that is both direct and sensitive, Lee has been collaborating with Hye-mi Cho since 2022. Their first joint work, <Floating Roots>, centers the voices of 1.5- and second-generation immigrants in Germany—particularly those of queer Asians—and was developed with accessibility for the Deaf community in mind.
","""Our existence was once destroyed, and now it is being destroyed once again. Our existence was once erased, and now, once again, it fades into oblivion.""

<Light Trees> metaphorically explores the mechanisms of violence. Inspired by the Japanese government’s distortion of the history of sexual slavery during World War II and its attempts to erase it, the work poetically yet directly depicts the process by which violence steals light and color, set against the backdrop of a non-human world where living beings and light coexist. While rooted in a specific historical context, the metaphorical approach resonates with various injustices across the world. The performance features two deaf artists and combines storytelling, sign language, moving light, and sound. Through music that incorporates a range of vibrations, audiences can physically sense the movement of sound. It is presented as a ‘relaxed performance’, allowing for free movement and flexible seating.

Yutnori: The Game That Nobody Plays These Days,"Full Performance, Theater",Cornerstone,,"<Yutnori: The Game That Nobody Plays These Days> is a reimagining of the late playwrigh Yoon Jo-byeong’s 1981 play <Yutnori>. In an age of accelerating technological advancement, materialism, and individualism, the work poses a fundamental question: “Where are we heading?” Through this, it invites pause, reflection, and awareness of life’s deeper values. Using the traditional Korean board game yutnori as a metaphor, the performance explores life’s unpredictability and cyclical nature, offering audiences a space for contemplation. The five outcomes of the game—Do, Gae, Geol, Yut, and Mo—symbolize the various phases of life, encouraging expanded perception. Within the game, the characters’ lives and deaths, past and present, intersect and overlap. With minimal theatrical tools—chalk-drawn boards, hands mimicking yut sticks, the sound of funeral chants and oral percussion—the piece lays bare the fragmentation and isolation of contemporary society. Our days, uncertain and unknowable, are likened to yut sticks: only by throwing them can we know where we’re going. This performance bridges tradition and modernity in Korean theater, offering a universal reflection on life and a rich artistic experience through new interpretations and expressions.",2025.11.06 / 2025.11.07 / 2025.11.08,20:00 ~ 21:30 / 20:00 ~ 21:30 / 15:00 ~ 16:30,Lee Chul-hui,"Kang ill, Sung-eun Kwak, Cheol-hoon Han, Kang-min Lee, Seul-gi Yoon, Jeong Hong Ku",90min,10,6,4,Kim Minsol,minsol0914@gmail.com,Lee O‑young Art Theater,"""The Yut board holds all the emotions of life — joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.
